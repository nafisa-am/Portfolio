# Brief Summary:

In this task I created web application from scratch! I built a portfolio page, which I will be using to showcase my work.

Here I have created my portfolio which includes my name, a current photo, and links to sections about me, my work and my contact details.

The navigations in the top of the page should direct to the corresponding sections of the page.

I have resized this page to be compatible with a tablet and mobile device.
